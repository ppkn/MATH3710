# Applied Regression and Time Series MATH 3710
Repo for Applied Regression and Time Series at UVU Spring 2016.  In the subfolders of this repo there are R implementaions from the samples shared in class from SAS. If you want all the code at once simply fork this repo and download it to your machine.  You'll need a free github account and git installed on your computer.
[Here's a link for more git/github info](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).
Rstudio is a great way to interact with git and github.  [Here is a link to some help](https://jennybc.github.io/2014-05-12-ubc/ubc-r/session03_git.html).

Have fun!
