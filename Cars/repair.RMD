Let's get started with R.  This first data set is small so we have the data loaded into two variable: minutes and units.  We then put them together witht the cbind function and store the result in a new variable called repair. 

```{r}
minutes <- c(23,29,49,64,74,87,96,97,109,119,149,145,154,166, NA)
units <- c(1,2,3,4,4,5,6,6,7,8,9,9,10,10,3)
repair <- cbind(minutes, units)
head(repair)
```
