```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#to check for required packages before running code.
if (!require(psych))
        {install.packages("psych")
        library(psych, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
}
#note: to make this work on your machine you may need to install the 
# psych package by typing into the console install.packages("psych")
# the reason I'm using this package is that the describe function from it
# produces output much like the SAS simple statistics output from the 
# PROC CORR procedure.  
```

Let's get started with simple linear regression using R.  This first data set is small so we have the data loaded into two variables: minutes and units.  We then put them together with the cbind function and store the result in a new variable called repair.

```{r}
units <- c(1,2,3,4,4,5,6,6,7,8,9,9,10,10,3)
minutes <- c(23,29,49,64,74,87,96,97,109,119,149,145,154,166, NA)
repair <- as.data.frame(cbind(units, minutes))
repair <- repair[complete.cases(repair), ] 
# note, the above line removes missing values.
describe(repair)
```

Above is a summary of the data table "repair".  Below is a table of the correlation coefficients.  

```{r}
cor(repair, method = "pearson", use = "complete.obs")
```

Here's a scatter plot of the data.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot(minutes ~ units, data=repair, bg = "lightblue", 
     col = "black", cex = 1.5, pch = 21)
# bg, col, cex, pch are all arguments to the plot function. They only determine
# how the plot appears.  
```


Now to display a summary of the model.  Above we fit a model with minutes being function of units.  We stored this model in a variable called m.

```{r}
m <- lm(minutes ~ units, data = repair)
anova(m) #ANOVA table
summary(m) #summary of linear model
```

Here we attempt to reproduce some of the output from the Proc Reg command in SAS.
```{r}
# add confidnece intervals
p <- predict.lm(m, se.fit = T, interval = "confidence")
psub <- p$fit[,2:3]
colnames(psub) <- c("95% Conf Lower", "95% Conf Upper")
s <- cbind(psub, stderror = p$se.fit)
# still need to add prediction intervals
# cbind is the commmand that binds columns together in either a 
# data frame or matrix.
t <- cbind(repair$minutes, fitted.values(m), residuals(m))
colnames(t) <- c("observed", "predicted", "residuals")
cbind(t, s)
```


Below is a plot of the residuals vs fitted and the Normal Quantile plot.  

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(m, which = c(1,2))
# the which argument in the plot function chooses the first two plots from the m model.
# the plot(m) call produces at least four plots.  We are only interested in the first 
# two at the moment.  
```


Now to plot a histogram of the residuals from our model.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#to hide from the md finte from Knit.
if (!require(ggplot2))
        {install.packages("ggplot2")
        library(ggplot2, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
}
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x <- rstandard(m)
qplot(x, bins = 3, xlab = "Standard Residuals", 
      main = "Histogram of Standard Residuals", fill = I("light blue"), 
      colour = I("black"))
```


Or we can plot the residuals this way, using ggplot.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
df <- data.frame(cbind(t, rstandard = rstandard(m)))
gg <- ggplot(df, aes(x = rstandard))
gg <- gg + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.75, colour="black", 
                          aes(y=..density.., fill=..count..))
gg <- gg + scale_fill_gradient("Count", low="#DCDCDC", high="#7C7C7C")
gg <- gg + stat_function(fun=dnorm, color="red",
                         arg = list(mean = mean(df$rstandard), 
                                    sd = sd(df$rstandard)))
gg <- gg + ggtitle("Histogram of Standard Residuals")
gg
```

Here we attempt to reproduce the same output as the Proc Univariate command in SAS.  Here the variable of interest is from our model m, rstandard.  
```{r}
describe(rstandard(m)) #this is using the library psych
t.test(rstandard(m))
#or, using base R
x <- rstandard(m)
mean(x)
sd(x) 
summary(x) 
var(x)
```

```{r}
u <- cbind(t, rstandard(m), hatvalues(m))
colnames(u) <- c("observed", "predicted", "residuals", "stdresid", "hatvals")
print(u)
# confidence intervals and se values can be obtained in R by using
# predict.lm(m, se.fit = T, interval = "confidence")
# where m is your fitted model. 

```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
# fit the least squares line to the plot.
# abline(lm(minutes ~ units, data = repair), lwd = 1, col = "red")
# to display the R^2 value on the graph
# legend("topleft", bty = "n", legend = paste("R^2 =", format(summary(m)$adj.r.squared, digits = 4)))
```
